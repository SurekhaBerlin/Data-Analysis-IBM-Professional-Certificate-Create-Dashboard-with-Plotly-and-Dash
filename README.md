# Data-Analysis-IBM-Professional-Certificate: Create Dashboard with Plotly and Dash

## Project: Analyzing the Impact of Recession on Automobile Sales

### Project Overview
Imagine you have been hired by an automobile company as a **Data Scientist**. Your first task is to analyze historical automobile sales data and provide the company directors with insights on how sales were affected during times of recession. The goal of this project is to **visualize trends and patterns** using interactive dashboards with **Plotly** and **Dash**, making complex data easy to understand for business stakeholders.

### Objectives
- Analyze the impact of economic recessions on automobile sales.  
- Explore relationships between sales and key economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rate, and consumer confidence.  
- Create interactive visualizations and dashboards to communicate findings effectively.  
- Identify seasonal trends and the influence of pricing, advertising, vehicle types, and market competition.

### Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following variables:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Date` | Date of the observation |
| `Recession` | Binary variable indicating recession periods (1 = recession, 0 = normal) |
| `Automobile_Sales` | Number of vehicles sold during the period |
| `GDP` | Per capita GDP in USD |
| `Unemployment_Rate` | Monthly unemployment rate |
| `Consumer_Confidence` | Synthetic index representing consumer confidence |
| `Seasonality_Weight` | Weight representing seasonality effects on sales |
| `Price` | Average vehicle price during the period |
| `Advertising_Expenditure` | Advertising spend by the company |
| `Vehicle_Type` | Type of vehicle sold (Superminicar, Smallfamilycar, Mediumfamilycar, Executivecar, Sports) |
| `Competition` | Measure of market competition (number of competitors or market share) |
| `Month` | Month extracted from `Date` |
| `Year` | Year extracted from `Date` |

### Key Questions Addressed
- How do recession periods impact overall automobile sales?  
- Which vehicle types are most affected during economic downturns?  
- How do economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment, and consumer confidence correlate with sales?  
- What role do pricing, advertising, and competition play in sales performance?  
- Are there noticeable seasonal trends in automobile sales?
